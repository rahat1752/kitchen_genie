# kitchen_genie

A new Flutter project.

KitchenGenie is a mobile app built using Flutter and integrated with the Yummly API to provide users with a list of simple and easy-to-follow recipes. With KitchenGenie, users can quickly browse through a wide variety of recipes and select the ones they want to try. The app's user-friendly interface makes it easy to search for recipes by ingredients, meal types, and dietary preferences. Whether you're an experienced home cook or a novice in the kitchen, KitchenGenie is the perfect app to help you create delicious meals in no time!

Here are some previews of my app:
